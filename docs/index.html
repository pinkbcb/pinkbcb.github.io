      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        In high school, I had to do a senior capstone project. Most people opted for doing service hours or an academic report. 
        I, however, took the initiative and completed a data science project analyzing equity and equality in public school funding. 
        This project shaped my passion for data science and opened my mind to programming, analytics, and the power of data to tell stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of that experience, I am now a student at Brigham Young University – Idaho majoring in Data Science. 
        I’m committed to finding data-driven solutions to complex problems. Through the Data Science Society, 
        I’ve gained valuable hands-on experience—most notably helping the local fire department optimize equipment purchasing, 
        repairs, and retirements. Our analysis doubled their budget allocation and brought their equipment up to code. 
        Projects like this deepen my understanding of how analytics can make real-world impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m eager to continue learning and collaborating within this fast-growing field. I’m passionate about transforming raw data into 
        meaningful insight and helping organizations make smarter, more ethical, and more effective decisions.

        <h3>How to Lie with Charts (and How to Spot It)</h3>
        <p>
          Data visualization is one of the most powerful tools in a data scientist’s toolkit — 
          but it’s also one of the easiest to misuse. From manipulated axes to cherry-picked samples, 
          misleading charts can make almost any conclusion seem “data-driven.”

        <h3>Why “Average” Is a Terrible Summary</h3>
        <p>
          “The average income is $75,000.” Sounds good, right? But what if half the population earns under $40,000 
          while a few outliers make millions? Suddenly that average doesn’t mean much.

        <h3>Correlation ≠ Causation — But It’s Still Useful</h3>
        <p>
          We’ve all heard the phrase “correlation does not equal causation,” and while that’s true, correlation still has immense practical value.
          In exploratory data analysis, correlations can identify potential relationships worth investigating.

        <h3>When “Cleaning” Data Changes Meaning</h3>
        <p>
          Every data project involves cleaning messy data — removing outliers, filling gaps, and normalizing formats. 
          But each of those steps is also a decision about what counts as “valid.”
