      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        In high school, I had to do a senior capstone project. Most people opted for doing service hours or an academic report. 
        I, however, took the initiative and completed a data science project analyzing equity and equality in public school funding. 
        This project shaped my passion for data science and opened my mind to programming, analytics, and the power of data to tell stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of that experience, I am now a student at Brigham Young University – Idaho majoring in Data Science. 
        I’m committed to finding data-driven solutions to complex problems. Through the Data Science Society, 
        I’ve gained valuable hands-on experience—most notably helping the local fire department optimize equipment purchasing, 
        repairs, and retirements. Our analysis doubled their budget allocation and brought their equipment up to code. 
        Projects like this deepen my understanding of how analytics can make real-world impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m eager to continue learning and collaborating within this fast-growing field. I’m passionate about transforming raw data into 
        meaningful insight and helping organizations make smarter, more ethical, and more effective decisions.

        <h3>How to Lie with Charts (and How to Spot It)</h3>
        <p>
          Data visualization is one of the most powerful tools in a data scientist’s toolkit — but it’s also one of the easiest to misuse.
          From manipulated axes to cherry-picked samples, misleading charts can make almost any conclusion seem “data-driven.”
          One classic example is truncating the y-axis to exaggerate differences that aren’t statistically meaningful.
          It’s not always malicious — sometimes it’s just poor design or lack of context — but the effect is the same:
          distorted interpretation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fix starts with transparency and literacy. Clear labeling, consistent scales, and annotated context help 
          audiences understand what the numbers truly represent. Likewise, analysts must challenge their own biases.
          A graph isn’t just decoration — it’s an argument. As professionals, our job is to make that argument honest, 
          reproducible, and clear. Learning to spot (and avoid) visual manipulation is a crucial part of ethical analytics.

        <h3>Why "Average" Is a Terrible Summary</h3>
        <p>
          “The average income is $75,000.” Sounds good, right? But what if half the population earns under $40,000 while a few outliers make millions? 
          Suddenly that average doesn’t mean much. The mean can hide inequality and distort understanding — especially in skewed distributions. 
          In many real-world datasets, the median tells a more truthful story about the “typical” experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          As data scientists, it’s our job to question whether the summary statistics we report actually represent the story our data tells. 
          Whenever possible, include context: show the spread, visualize the distribution, and mention outliers. 
          “Average” is a starting point — not the conclusion. The best analysis moves beyond single numbers and captures 
          the complexity of the underlying data.

        <h3>Correlation ≠ Causation — But It’s Still Useful</h3>
        <p>
          We’ve all heard the phrase “correlation does not equal causation,” and while that’s true, correlation still has immense practical value.
          In exploratory data analysis, correlations can identify potential relationships worth investigating. 
          For instance, if higher call volume correlates with slower response times, that doesn’t prove one causes the other —
          but it does point to an operational bottleneck worth digging into.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key is to use correlation responsibly. It’s a signal, not a conclusion. Combine it with domain knowledge, 
          hypothesis testing, and controlled experimentation. Correlation can’t give you causality, 
          but it can absolutely help you find where to look next — and in data science, knowing where to look is half the battle.

        <h3>When “Cleaning” Data Changes Meaning</h3>
        <p>
          Every data project involves cleaning messy data — removing outliers, filling gaps, and normalizing formats. 
          But each of those steps is also a decision about what counts as “valid.” And those decisions can unintentionally 
          alter the story the data tells. When we delete “inconsistent” records, are we correcting errors or erasing exceptions? 
          When we fill in missing values, are we clarifying patterns or fabricating them?
        </p>
        <p>
          Ethical data cleaning requires reflection and documentation. Analysts should always record their choices and 
          justify them based on the goals of the analysis. Data integrity isn’t about perfection — it’s about honesty. 
          The moment we start deciding what data “should” look like, we step into interpretation. 
          Owning that responsibility makes our work both more transparent and more trustworthy.
